## ❌ Problems with Traditional Crowdfunding Platforms

Most existing crowdfunding platforms face the following issues:

- **Lack of Transparency**  
  Donors cannot easily verify how much money was raised or where it was spent.

- **Trust Issues & Fraud**  
  Fundraisers rely on centralized intermediaries, making platforms vulnerable to misuse of funds.

- **Delayed or Manipulated Records**  
  Donation histories can be altered or hidden by platform owners.

- **Limited Donor Control**  
  Donors have no direct visibility into transactions once payment is made.

  Smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries, ensuring funds go directly to the fundraiser.

- **Immutable Donation Records**  
  Once recorded on-chain, transactions cannot be altered or deleted.

- **Wallet-based Donations**  
  Users donate directly using MetaMask, maintaining full control over their funds.

  Blockchain ensures transparency, while a backend database manages fundraiser metadata efficiently.
